# {DRAGONGLASS} kills white walkers....
----------------------------

It is more valuable to us now.. than gold.

We need to find it-

We need to MINE it-

We need to MAKE weapons from it


The ONLY thing now that stands between us.. 
and the Army of the dead - 
Is one last and Final season..
        Season  8 
     GAME OF THRONES.

We shall begin trading of {DRGL} with every man, woman, and child- whilst crowning only the most rightful of Exchange(s).. as our 8th and Final Season arrives.
_________________________________________________

Every House shall be called upon to join in alliance. We must fight together- alongside one another, to defeat our common enemy.  
Any contributions to all future {DRÆGONGLASS} developments are not only welcomed, but encouraged. There is much, still, that remains to be done...For the Night is Dark, and Full of Terrors.

This process of mining , however..
must begin...now.

CryptoNight-Classic (Proof-of-Work) mining algorithm.

Block Time - 81 secs

Block Reward - begin 30 DRGL and ever so slightly decreasing.. (smooth emission curve)

Approx 80% of all {DRGL} is set to be mined by final season debut

8,000,008 max supply | 8 Million 8 | precisely: 8000008.8000008 DRGL

THERE  IS  ONLY  ONE  WAR  THAT  MATTERS..

The Great War.



And it is here.

## Building {Dragonglass} 

### On *nix

1. Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55.

You may download them from:

* http://gcc.gnu.org/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/



*** Alternatively, it may be possible to install them using a package manager by
executing the following command.     {Tested using Ubuntu 16.04}
 ```
 sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake libboost1.55-all-dev
```

2. Clone {dragonglass} repository

*** Execute the following command to copy a desired repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ZirtysPerzys/DRGL
```


3. Open folder with copied repository

*** Execute the following command to get into the directory with copied repository

`cd DRGL`



4. Building (Compiling)

*** Execute the following command to compile

`
make -j4  
`

The resulting executables can be found in build/release/src.


5. Starting {dragonglass} daemon
*** Execute the following command to navigate to resulting executables

`
cd DRGL/build/release/src 
`


*** Start daemon, typing the following command-

`
./dragonglassd 
`

for a list of commands in daemon type  --help




After you are have very success,
see {DRAGONGLASS GUI Wallet}

_________________________________________________________
**Advanced options:**

* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`.
* Debug build: run `make build-debug`.
* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.
* Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.

**************************************************************************************************
### On Windows
Dependencies: MSVC 2013 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.55. You may download them from:

* http://www.microsoft.com/
* http://www.cmake.org/
* http://www.boost.org/

To build, change to a directory where this file is located, and run these commands: 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" ..
```

And then do Build.

On windows 10
Quick step by step tutorial


Activate the Bash terminal as shown in this tutorial
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10


Start a Bash window and do as follow

1:Go to root
cd

2: Run updates and install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake libboost-all-dev

3: Git clone
git clone https://github.com/ZirtysPerzys/DRGL.git

4: Build the files
cd dragonglass
make

5: Sync blocks
cd build/release/src/
./dragonglassd

!!keep this terminal running and open new terminal for next step!!

6: Start simplewallet and create wallet (navigate to the folder where you created the wallet)
~dragonglass/build/release/src$ ./simplewallet
or
cd dragonglass/build/release/src
./simplewallet

set up wallet name & password
then start mining in wallet
start_mining <number_of_threads>

use "help" in wallet to check other commands

!!Remember you have to use linux command in Bash

You'll find your folders and wallet in
C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\lxss\home

----------
for Mac client/GUI build release

-Reserved bounty funded by {DRGL} community-


### Building for Android on Linux

Set up the 32 bit toolchain
Download and extract the Android SDK and NDK
```
android-ndk-r15c/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py --api 21 --stl=libc++ --arch arm --install-dir /opt/android/tool32
```

Download and setup the Boost 1.65.1 source
```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.65.1/boost_1_65_1.tar.bz2/download -O boost_1_65_1.tar.bz2
tar xjf boost_1_65_1.tar.bz2
cd boost_1_65_1
./bootstrap.sh
```
apply patch from external/boost1_65_1/libs/filesystem/src

Build Boost with the 32 bit toolchain
```
export PATH=/opt/android/tool32/arm-linux-androideabi/bin:/opt/android/tool32/bin:$PATH
./b2 abi=aapcs architecture=arm binary-format=elf address-model=32 link=static runtime-link=static --with-chrono --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-program_options --with-regex --with-serialization --with-system --with-thread --with-context --with-coroutine --with-atomic --build-dir=android32 --stagedir=android32 toolset=clang threading=multi threadapi=pthread target-os=android --reconfigure stage
```

Build {DRGL} for 32 bit Android
```
mkdir -p build/release.android32
